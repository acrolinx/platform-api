# Acrolinx API

![Build](https://github.com/acrolinx/platform-api/actions/workflows/actions.yml/badge.svg)

Welcome to the Acrolinx API!
This documentation helps you:

* use the API directly
* build your own integration
* understand how Acrolinx interacts with integrations.

The [reference](#reference) describes all services and methods.

## Prerequisites

Contact [Acrolinx support](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/master/topics/support.md)
for consulting and getting your integration certified.
This sample works with a test license on an Acrolinx test instance.
The license is only meant for demonstration and development.
Once you finish coding, contact Acrolinx to get a license for your integration.
  
Acrolinx provides different SDKs and samples for building integrations.

Before you start building your own integration, you might want to read the following:

* [Getting started with custom integrations](https://docs.acrolinx.com/customintegrations)
* [How to integrate with Acrolinx](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance)
* [Acrolinx SDKs](https://github.com/acrolinx?q=sdk)
* [Acrolinx demo projects](https://github.com/acrolinx?q=demo).

## Get started

You'll need the following:

* An Acrolinx instance URL
* A user on that Acrolinx instance
* A signature (more on that later)
* A way to make http calls
* A way to read and write JSON strings

Familiarize yourself with the following concepts: 
* [authentication](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/master/topics/configuration.md)
* [signatures](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/master/topics/packaging.md#packaging)
* [document](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/master/topics/text-extraction.md).

If you can't wait, jump to the [Quick start tutorial](quickstart.md) and start playing around.

## Important headers and content type

Always include the following headers:

```HTTP
X-Acrolinx-Auth: YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
X-Acrolinx-Client: YOUR_SIGNATURE;YOUR_VERSION
Content-Type:application/json
```

Individual topics explain the contents of these headers.
All requests to the Acrolinx API should contain these headers.

## Authentication

To use the Authentication API, you'll need an access token.
Send the access token with the header parameter `X-Acrolinx-Auth` for every API request.

```HTTP
X-Acrolinx-Auth:SOME_ACCESS_TOKEN_STRING
```

Access tokens are associated with a user and come in two forms:

* default access tokens that you get by signing in to Acrolinx
* API tokens.

Access tokens normally have a lifetime of 30 days. After that, you have to renew them.

API tokens have a lifespan of 4 years.

## Get an access token with Acrolinx sign-in

The Acrolinx sign-in process is for individual users to sign in.
An Acrolinx web application handles the authentication.

This is how it works:

![Sign-in diagram](doc/sign-in.png)

1. Integration requests an access token:

    ```HTTP
    POST: https://tenant.acrolinx.cloud/api/v1/auth/sign-ins
    ```

2. Acrolinx returns two URLs: an `interactive` and a `poll` URL in a result like this:

    ```HTTP
    {
        "data": {
            "state": "Started",
            "interactiveLinkTimeout": 900
        },
        "links": {
            "interactive": "https://tenant.acrolinx.cloud/dashboard.html?login=19901-2-8412998412",
            "poll": "https://tenant.acrolinx.cloud/api/v1/auth/sign-ins/185-0ijfgklejt2390tui"
        }
    }
    ```

3. Prompt the `interactive` URL for the user to authenticate.
    Poll with the `poll` URL until you get an http response (code 200).

    ```HTTP
    {
        "data": {
            "state": "Success",
            "accessToken": "123579080a8d1fee12490a90dc3",
            "authorizedUsing": "ACROLINX_SIGN_IN",
            "privileges": [
            "CheckingAndClients.checkingApplications",
            "CheckingAndClients.submitDictionaryEntry"
            ],
            "userId": "fred"
        },
        "links": {
            "user": "https://tenant.acrolinx.cloud/api/v1/user/fred"
        }
    }
    ```

## Create an API token

Creating an API Token is easy:

* Sign in to Acrolinx
* Go to â€˜Settings'
* Click CREATE API TOKEN.
* Copy the API token.

**Note**
As soon as you generate an API token, save it somewhere secure (like a password manager) so that you can access it again. Once you leave the Settings page, the API token will disappear from the display.

## Signature

A signature is a string that identifies an integration.
During development, you should use the following signature:

```TEXT
SW50ZWdyYXRpb25EZXZlbG9wbWVudERlbW9Pbmx5
```

Once Acrolinx certifies your integration, you'll get your own signature.

Inclue the signature as a header in every request you send to the Acrolinx API:

```HTTP
X-Acrolinx-Client: YOUR_SIGNATURE; VERSION_NUMBER
```

The `VERSION_NUMBER` should follow the following pattern `X.X.X.X` like `1.0.0.1`.

You don't have to send a
[version and build number](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/master/topics/project-setup.md#version-information).
But to get [certified](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/master/topics/checklist.md),
your integration must send this information.
Maintaining your integration in production is much easier with a version and build number.

## FAQ (frequently asked questions)

* How do I authenticate and use SSO?
    + Authentication requires either an API token or Acrolinx sign-in.
      Acrolinx sign-in supports different SSO methods that use PingFederate.
* How do the API and automation SDKs (Java, JavaScript, etc.) work together?
    + We build SDKs on top of the API and use the API to provide a basic framework in languages like Java or JavaScript.
* Can I include hierarchies in the document reference, for example: `<book>`, `<chapter>`, `<section>`
  so Acrolinx reporting groups all check results for the book, chapter, etc.?
    + If you want to group content, you should use document custom fields. You can also use the API to manage custom fields.
      Acroilnx uses the document reference to identify a piece of content but Acrolinx doesn't use the document reference to group content.
* Can I add a link for each document in a batch check so the Content Analysis Dashboard provides a link back to the documents in the overview?
    + In most cases, a document reference is the link to your content.
      If you need to provide a separate or different link, you can use custom fields.

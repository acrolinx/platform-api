# Acrolinx API

![Build](https://github.com/acrolinx/platform-api/actions/workflows/actions.yml/badge.svg)

Welcome to the Acrolinx API!
This documentation helps you:

* use the API directly
* build your own integration
* understand how Acrolinx interacts with integrations

The [API reference](https://acrolinxapi.docs.apiary.io) describes all
services and methods.

## Get started

Contact [Acrolinx support](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/master/topics/support.md)
for consulting and getting your integration certified.

Acrolinx provides different SDKs and samples for building integrations.

Before you start building your own integration, you might want to read
the following:

* [Getting started with custom integrations](https://docs.acrolinx.com/customintegrations)
* [How to integrate with Acrolinx](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance)
* [Acrolinx SDKs](https://github.com/acrolinx?q=sdk)
* [Acrolinx demo projects](https://github.com/acrolinx?q=demo).

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following:

* An Acrolinx URL
* A user on that Acrolinx instance
* A signature

Understand the following concepts:
* [authentication](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/main/topics/authentication.md)
* [signatures](#signature)
* [document](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/main/topics/text-extraction.md#whats-a-document).

## Authentication

To use the Authentication API, you'll need an access token. Send the
access token with the header parameter `X-Acrolinx-Auth` for every API
request.

```HTTP
X-Acrolinx-Auth:SOME_ACCESS_TOKEN_STRING
```

Access tokens are associated with a user and come in two forms:

1. Access tokens that you get by signing in to Acrolinx

   Access tokens normally have a lifetime of 30 days. After that, you
   have to renew them.
2. API tokens

   API tokens have a lifespan of 4 years.

## Acrolinx sign-in process

The Acrolinx sign-in process is for individual users to sign in.
An Acrolinx web application handles the authentication.

This is how it works:

![Sign-in diagram](doc/sign-in.png)

1. Integration requests an access token:

    ```HTTP
    POST: https://tenant.acrolinx.cloud/api/v1/auth/sign-ins
    ```

2. Acrolinx returns two URLs: an `interactive` and a `poll` URL in a
   result like this:

    ```HTTP
    {
        "data": {
            "state": "Started",
            "interactiveLinkTimeout": 900
        },
        "links": {
            "interactive": "https://tenant.acrolinx.cloud/dashboard.html?login=19901-2-8412998412",
            "poll": "https://tenant.acrolinx.cloud/api/v1/auth/sign-ins/185-0ijfgklejt2390tui"
        }
    }
    ```

3. Prompt the `interactive` URL for the user to authenticate.
    Poll with the `poll` URL until you get an http response (code 200).

    ```HTTP
    {
        "data": {
            "state": "Success",
            "accessToken": "123579080a8d1fee12490a90dc3",
            "authorizedUsing": "ACROLINX_SIGN_IN",
            "privileges": [
            "CheckingAndClients.checkingApplications",
            "CheckingAndClients.submitDictionaryEntry"
            ],
            "userId": "fred"
        },
        "links": {
            "user": "https://tenant.acrolinx.cloud/api/v1/user/fred"
        }
    }
    ```

## Create an API token

Creating an API token is easy:

1. Sign in to Acrolinx.
2. Go to your â€˜Settings'.
3. Click CREATE API TOKEN.
4. Copy the API token.

**Note** After you generate an API token, save it somewhere secure
(like a password manager) so that you can access it again. Once you
leave the Settings page, the API token will no longer appear on
screen.

## Signature

A signature is a string that identifies an integration.

Include the signature as a header in every request you send to the
Acrolinx API:

```HTTP
X-Acrolinx-Client: YOUR_SIGNATURE; VERSION_NUMBER
```

The `VERSION_NUMBER` should follow the following pattern `X.X.X.X` like `1.0.0.1`.

To get
[certified](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/master/topics/checklist.md),
your integration needs to send the [version and build
number](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/master/topics/project-setup.md#version-information).

Maintaining your integration in production is much easier with a
version and build number.

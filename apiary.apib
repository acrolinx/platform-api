# Acrolinx Platform API

The Acrolinx Platform API is the new REST like API for accessing the Core Platform.

**NOTE:** All listed (future) features, which aren't yet or only partially implemented, are marked with the keyword DRAFT. Please consider this while using the Acrolinx Platform API!

# Authentication and Authorization

When using the Acrolinx Platform API, you'll need to be authorized and authenticated. This is done by providing an **Access Token**.

An **Access Token** is an encoded and cryptographically signed string. It has the following characteristics:

* It's bound to a user
* There can be an infinite number of Access Tokens per user
* It has a certain lifetime (default 30 days, can be changed)
* It will expire after the lifetime or when the password of the associated user is changed
* It provides authorization and authentication

How to get an **Access Token**?
You can get an Access Token by using the Acrolinx sign-in workflow.
(further description here)

How to use an Access Token?

Every request you make with the Acrolinx Platform API must contain a [header](#header-access-token) that provides the Access Token:

```
    X-Acrolinx-Auth: WERTZUIOP
```

## API Token
An API Token is an Access Token but with special characteristics:

* It has a lifetime of 4 years
* It will **not expire when the password of the associated user is changed**
* Only one API Token can be bound to a user at the time

How to get API Token:
* Accessing the user settings page on the Dashboard and generating one.
* Programmatically using the **User API**. (See more under the **User Generated API Tokens** section)

Other than that, the **API Token** functions as an **Access Token**.

# General Headers

## Access Token

All methods except "index" and "poll access token" require a valid access token in the `X-Acrolinx-Auth` header even if not explicitly mentioned below.
If the token is invalid, a `401` response is returned (see `401` response of "index") even if this response isn't explicitly mentioned below.

Example:

```
    X-Acrolinx-Auth: 123579080a8d1fee12490a90dc3
```

## Base URL

To support reverse proxies, a client may provide the `X-Acrolinx-Base-Url` header with each request. If the response body to the request
contains links into the Acrolinx API, the server will prefix them with the given value. The provided value must be an absolute URL including scheme and host.
Malformed values will result in a `400` status code.

Example:

```
    X-Acrolinx-Base-Url: https://example.com/path/
```

## Client Locale

All methods accept a header `X-Acrolinx-Client-Locale` that the client can use to identify its own locale (for example, UI language).
The value of the header field needs to be a single language tag that complies with [BCP 47](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt). The Acrolinx Platform will try to return message strings
and other locale-specific parts of the response in the requested language.

Example:

```
    X-Acrolinx-Client-Locale: de-CH
```

The server tries to match the sent locale to the closest locale that it's able to support, for example, `de`.
The "index" request returns the list of supported locales. The server falls back to the default `en` locale in the following cases:

* no X-Acrolinx-Client-Locale header is sent
* there's no matching supported locale
* for the given response, there's no appropriate localization available

## Signature

If not otherwise documented, all methods require you to set a header `X-Acrolinx-Client`. The header needs to be a valid signature. The request
returns an error if the header is omitted or if the signature provided is invalid.

The format of the signature is `Signature;Version`, where `Signature` is the signature as configured in the Acrolinx license and
`Version` is the version number of the client.

Example:

```
    X-Acrolinx-Client: SW50ZWdyYXRpb25EZXZlbG9wbWVudERlbW9Pbmx5; 1.0.1.45
```

# Response Format

The API provides a consistent format for all responses. Each response has a field `links` and one of the three fields `error`, `progress`, `data`.

The `links` field contains further URLs that can be used as a next step in the workflow.
`error` is set if the request didn't succeed. This is accompanied by an HTTP status code above or equal 4xx.
`progress` means that the processing isn't finished yet and the client has to poll for the final result.
`data` contains the actual result data, the processing is successfully finished.

## Error Responses

### General Format

The API provides a consistent format for errors, which is based on [RFC7807](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7807/?include_text=1).
The format is JSON and the API guarantees to send the fields `type`, `title`, `detail`, `status` with each error response.

Example:

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/problem+json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "auth",
    "title": "Invalid authentication",
    "detail": "The provided token for authorization is not valid.",
    "status": 403
  }
  "links": {}
}
```

* `type` is a unique identifier for the type of error. A client may choose a workflow for the error handling depending on the type.
* `title` is a short description of the error. You can display this to users as the title of the error message.
* `detail` is a longer description of the error. You can also display this for users.
* `status` is redundant to the HTTP status code. It may be helpful in case a proxy changed the HTTP status code of the original API response.
* You might also see an optional `reference` field with an ID. If present, you can find this ID in the Acrolinx log files to help with troubleshooting.

Depending on `type`, additional fields may be part of the response providing more detailed information.

Additional fields may be added in future. A client must not break because of unexpected fields.



### Error Types

Type | Description| What to do
-----|------------|------------
`client` | Unspecific error caused by the client's request. | Check logs and configuration or the client code.
`server` | Unspecific error during processing of a request in Acrolinx. | Check logs and configuration.
`clientSignatureMissing` | The `X-Acrolinx-Client` header was missing.  | [Contact Acrolinx](https://www.acrolinx.com/contact/) to learn how to get a valid license.
`clientSignatureRejected` | The given signature in the `X-Acrolinx-Client` header was invalid. | [Contact Acrolinx](https://www.acrolinx.com/contact/) to learn how to get a valid license.
`sso` | Returned for any single sign-on errors. | This is likely a configuration issue.
`auth` | Invalid authentication. | Use another access token.
`insufficientPrivileges` | Insufficient privileges. | Assign the required privileges to the user.
`interactiveSignInTimedOut` | The interactive sign-in process timed out. | Sign in again.
`checkCancelled` | The check was canceled. No result is available. | Probably points to an error in the client.
`checkFailed` | The check failed. | Check logs and configuration.
`invalidBaseUrl` | The request contained an invalid base URL in the `X-Acrolinx-Base-URL` header. | Check configuration of client or proxies, which set the header.
`customFieldsIncorrect` | Custom field values are incorrect. |Please provide valid values for all required custom fields before or when checking a document.
`validation` | Invalid request attributes. | Check the request for invalid values or missing parameters.
`guidanceProfileDoesntExist` | Guidance profile doesn't exist. | The guidance profile doesn't exist or isn't available for the user ID and language provided.
`noGuidanceProfileConfigured` | No guidance profile configured. | No guidance profile is configured for the user ID and language provided.
`contentTooLarge` | File too large. | Try checking less content.
`queueLimitExceeded` | Queue limit exceeded. | Wait at least as long as suggested in the retry-after header and try another check.
`conflict` | Concurrent write access. | Conflict with a concurrent write access. Try again with fresh data.
`licenseLimitExceeded` | License limit exceeded. | You exceeded a limit set by the terms of your license. The error description contains more details. Please check [the documentation](https://support.acrolinx.com/hc/en-us/articles/10306079192082-License-Types) for more information.
`entityToAssociateNotFound` | One or more associates to an entity could not be found. | Make sure that the given associates actually exist.


### Additional Information On Validation Errors

Errors with type `validation` come with a list of constraint violation descriptions in an additional property `validationDetails`:

```
{
    "title": "Validation error",
    "constraint": "The 'languageId' is required.",
    "attributePath": "submit.arg1.languageId",
    "detail": "The 'languageId' is required but was 'null'.",
    "invalidValue": "DictionaryEntry{surface='TestSurface', scope=language, languageId='', guidanceProfileId='null', documentId='null'}",
    "possibleValues": ["en", "de"]
}

```
* `title`: "Validation error"
* `constraint`: A minimal description of the constraint that was violated.
* `attributePath`: A hint towards the property or parameter that had an invalid value.
* `detail`: A more detailed description of the constraint violation.
* `invalidValue`: The value that was invalid. Can be a data structure.
* `possibleValues`: An optional list of valid values for the property.


The `validationDetails` are intended as information for developers to troubleshoot bad requests.
They are not intended for automated consumption.
Values are not guaranteed to be always present or in a uniform format.



## Progress Responses

A progress response always contains a field `retryAfter`, which tells the client how many seconds to wait until the next poll request.
Optionally the response can have the fields `message`, that contains a human user readable text about the current status, and `percent`, that
is a number and shows the progress in percent.
A progress response has always the `Retry-After` header set with the same value as the `retryAfter` field and an HTTP status 202.

Examples:

```
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "progress": {
    "message": "The request is queued on position 5.",
    "percent": 2,
    "retryAfter": 5
  }
  "links": {
    "cancel": "https://tenant.acrolinx.cloud/api/v1/checks/ID100"
  }
}
```

```
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "progress": {
    "retryAfter": 1
  }
  "links": {}
}
```

## Successful Responses

The fields of a successful response with data depend on the request.

Example:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "data": {
    "score": 99,
    "textualScore": "Good job!"
  }
  "links": {
    "submit": "https://tenant.acrolinx.cloud/api/v1/checks"
  }
}
```

# HTML Fields

Responses may have fields with HTML snippets to provide nice formatting in interactive clients. Those fields are clearly marked by a name that ends with "Html", for example, "guidanceHtml". There may be related fields with the same content in plain text. If such a field exists, it ends with "Text" like in the example, "guidanceText".

All HTML fields only contain formatting tags that can be used without security risks. All tags are filtered by a server-side allow list.

# Group Index

## Platform Capabilities [GET /api/v1/capabilities]

An aggregation of the capabilities of the APIs sub-resources. This resource serves a single entry point for clients that need
to use more than one feature of the API.

+ Response 200 (application/json)
    + Attributes
        + data (object)
            + checking (object) - capabilities of the checking resource
            + document (object) - capabilities of the document resource
        + links (object)


# Group Authentication API

Authentication is handled either with a configured access token, with single sign-on (SSO) or in an interactive process by signing in with the Acrolinx sign-in web page.
Embedded integrations use either the configured access token or SSO.
Interactive clients with a human user use SSO or the interactive process.

## Request/Validate an API Token [POST /api/v1/auth/sign-ins]

The sign-in collection allows Acrolinx API clients to request user authentication and to check
the validity and privileges of existing access tokens.

If the Acrolinx Platform is configured for single sign-on, this endpoint will accept the configured credentials
to authenticate the request.

+ Request (application/json)

    + Header

            X-Acrolinx-Auth: 123579080a8d1fee12490a90dc3 (valid) OR (invalid/expired access token) OR (no access token)
            X-Acrolinx-Client-Locale: ja
            X-Acrolinx-Client: QWxlU2hNyb2bHVnLWlunhQyR29Rm9xpbvZ2lZXRz; 1.0.1.45;

+ Response 200 (application/json)
    No sign-in needed, the response body will contain valid access tokens.

    The server may decide that the request is already sufficiently authorized. In this case,
    no sign-in process is started. The response will contain the same information as after
    successful sign-in procedure. The following conditions may lead to this response:

    - The `X-Acrolinx-Auth` header contained a valid token.
    - Single sign-on is configured and valid credentials are supplied.

    + Attributes (object)

+ Response 201 (application/json)
    If the `X-Acrolinx-Auth` header is absent a
    new sign-in process is started. The response body contains two links.
    One allows the user to complete the sign-in process.
    The other helps the client to acquire the session data:

    - `interactive` a link to a website that allows the user to authenticate and
          permit the client to access the server. If a language was provided in the
          `X-Acrolinx-Client-Locale` header, the link will point to a localized
          version of that website if available and technically possible.

    - `poll` a link to a resource that will return an *access token* and information
          about the user after sign-in. (see [GET `api/v1/auth/sign-ins/{id}`](#authentication-api-poll-for-a-new-api-token-get))

    Note that the sign-in process will time out. The `interactiveLinkTimeout` field
    contains the duration in seconds, that the `interactive` link will stay valid. If the
    Sign-in page was loaded before this time, the server will extend
    the timeout. To detect timeouts after opening the Sign-in page use the `poll` link.

    + Body

            {
              "data": {
                "state": "Started",
                "interactiveLinkTimeout": 900
              },
              "links": {
                  "interactive": "https://tenant.acrolinx.cloud/dashboard.html?login=19901-2-8412998412",

+ Response 401 (application/json)
    If invalid SSO credentials are supplied the request is rejected. This occurs when an SSO username
    is present but the SSO password is wrong or missing or the user couldn't be created.

    + Header

            WWW-Authenticate: ACROLINX_TOKEN, ACROLINX_SIGN_IN (, ACROLINX_SSO)

    + Attributes (object)

+ Response 503
    The server is unable to start a sign-in process at this time.

    + Header

            Retry-After: 30

    + Attributes (object)

## Poll for a New API Token [GET /api/v1/auth/sign-ins/{id}]

This resource lets a client wait for a user to authenticate and authorize it to use the
privileged parts of the Acrolinx API. Once the user has completed the sign-in process,
it will return a new access token. It can be sent with each API call to prove the
privileges and identity owned by the user that signed in.

When polling returned a final result, the polling endpoint will disappear and return a `NOT FOUND` status.

+ Parameters
    + id: `99576707-ed8c-44b6-82b8-c3ced8f349d1` (string, required) - poll-id for the authorization request

+ Request

    + Header

            X-Acrolinx-Client: QWxlU2hNyb2bHVnLWlunhQyR29Rm9xpbvZ2lZXRz; 1.0.1.45

+ Response 200 (application/json)
   A user has completed the sign-in process and the server has created a new access token.

   Note that this resource will disappear after this response.

   + Attributes (object)

+ Response 202 (application/json)
   The user hasn't authorized the sign-in yet. Request the same URI again to continue polling.
   Note that clients should pace themselves by respecting the `Retry-After` header.

    + Header

            Retry-After: 2

    + Attributes
        + progress
           + `retryAfter`: 2 (number, required)

+ Response 404 (application/json)
    The server has no knowledge of the polling token. If a valid poll URI was used, the cause for this is
    a timeout or another poll request may have consumed the credentials.

    The returned type is `interactive_sign_in_timed_out`, which distinguishes this response from a normal 404 caused by a just wrong URL.

    + Attributes
       + error
         + `type`: `interactive_sign_in_timed_out` (string, required)
         + `status`: 404 (number, required)
         + title: `The interactive sign-in process timed out` (string, required)
         + detail: `The interactive sign-in process timed out. Please start a sign-in.` (string, required)


# Group Checking API

The API for checking documents.

## List Checking Capabilities [GET /api/v1/checking/capabilities]

The new checking API replaces writing guides and Content Profiles with a flat list of guidance profiles. Each guidance profile corresponds to a
writing guide or a Checking Profile. If Sublanguages are activated, they're folded into the list of guidance profiles.

For each guidance profile, the server provides information about the language, activated goals, and term sets. The client may use this
for filtering purposes, but they can only select one (complete) guidance profile for checking (for example, not deselect goals).

If the server runs in Targets Mode, the goals contain an additional string field called `scoring`. It can have the values
`required` (meaning this goal will be included in the calculation of the overall score so it is required to take this goal into account
when creating content) or `recommended` (meaning this goal is a recommendation only and does not count towards the overall document score).

**Note:** Before you get started with the Checking API, be sure to review the [authentication and authorization](https://acrolinxapi.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/authentication-and-authorization) requirements.

##  Submit a Check [POST /api/v1/checking/checks]

Submits a file for checking. After the file is uploaded, it will be scheduled for checking. Once Acrolinx is done checking the document,
all results will be collected and made available. This leads to the following steps when using the check API:

* submit a check
* poll for progress
* download check results

For an overview on what documents and file types are supported by Acrolinx please consult the list of
[Supported Input Types](https://support.acrolinx.com/hc/en-us/articles/10211264846482-Supported-Input-Types).
The same information is available in the checking capabilities.

## Check Result [/api/v1/checking/checks/{id}]

### Check Result How-To

#### Ignore All Issue Occurrences
Every issue in the check result has the attribute `positionalInformation.hashes.issue`. You can use this attribute to find all occurrences of an issue. All these issues can be ignored together.

The integration can also remember the `positionalInformation.hashes.issue` attribute after an ignore-all operation. This lets you filter out all previously ignored occurrences of an issue after a recheck.

#### Replace All Issue Occurrences with a Suggestion
Every issue in the check result has the attribute `positionalInformation.hashes.issue`. You can use this attribute to find all occurrences of an issue.

To apply a suggestion to all occurrences of an issue, use the `groupId` attribute to find the corresponding suggestion.
If an occurrence of an issue doesn't have a suggestion with the same `groupId` or if the `groupId` is empty, then it can't be replaced with a replace-all operation.

Note that not all occurrences of an issue always have the same suggestions. In this case, the replace-all operation only applies to issues with the same suggestion.


### Poll Check Result [GET]

Polls the check result. Either a progress or the completed result is returned. The URL for the request is found in the submitted check's "result" link.

# Group User API

**Available since Core Platform version 2018.10**

In the User API, Acrolinx defines a user as an entity that has an id, a username, a fullName, and custom properties (set by the client).

You're _required_ to provide user information for the following:
* Interactive integrations: When you sign in to the Acrolinx Sidebar, you need to enter your user information. This creates an access token for the signed-in user.
* Embedded integrations (API key-based): When you sign in to the Acrolinx Dashboard, you need to enter customer user information. This lets you generate an API token for the user that’s signed in.

Security:
* A user can read and update its own data.
* Only privileged users (admin, for example) can read or update other users' data.

**Note:** Before you get started with the User API, be sure to review the [authentication and authorization](https://acrolinxapi.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/authentication-and-authorization) requirements. 

## User Resource [/api/v1/user]

### Get All Users [GET /api/v1/user{?sort,page,per_page,username,fullName,roles}]

**Added in Core Platform version 2021.05**

**Note:** The table below shows the specific API request parameters by Core Platform version.

| API Request                                                 | Core Platform Version |
|:------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `[GET /api/v1/user{?sort}]`                                 | `2021.06`             |
| `[GET /api/v1/user{?page,per_page}]`                        | `2021.08`             |
| `[GET /api/v1/user{?sort=customFields.{customFieldName}}]`  | `2021.12`             |
| `[GET /api/v1/user{?username,fullName}]`                    | `2022.02`             |
| `[GET /api/v1/user{?roles}]`                                | `2022.02`             |
| `[GET /api/v1/user{?excludeProperties={true|false}}]`       | `2023.10`             |
| `[GET /api/v1/user{?includeCustomField={key}}]`             | `2023.10`             |

This request retrieves a list of all users in the order that they were added.

**Searching/Filtering**

- You can use the `username` and `fullName` parameters to search or filter users.
- The `username` and `fullName` query parameters are limited to 255 characters, are optional, and can't be `null`.
- If the `username` and `fullName` parameters are set, the API will list users that match both parameters.
- You can use the `roles` parameter to filter users by multiple role ids.
- Invalid role ids will return an empty list.

**Sorting**

If you use the `sort` query parameter, you can only sort the list of users by 1 field.
To display the list in ascending or descending order respectively, you can add a `+` or `-`.

**Sorting Notes:**

- You can only sort by 1 field.
- A query parameter can be any length and can include the order direction prefixes "+" and "-".
- A query parameter can't be empty or include blank spaces.
- A query parameter can accept a mix of characters.
- By default, the list appears in ascending order.
- The list is also sorted by `username` unless this is already the primary sort column.
- Other sort columns include: `fullName`, `createdOn`, `lastIntegrationAccess`, `checkingFrequency`, `licenseType`, `licenseStatus`, and `customFields.{key}`.
- The query parameter `licenseType` sorts by two fields: `licenseType` and `licenseStatus`.
- To sort by a custom field, the sort value needs to include `customFields`, `.`, and the `{key}`. The key is the name of the custom field.

When you sort by `customFields` in ascending order, empty `customFields` values will appear at the beginning of the list. If you sort
in descending order, empty values will appear at the end of the list.

To make sure that the sorting behavior for custom fields is consistent, the following special characters can be sorted: `` !@$^*()_+-=,./;'[]<>?:|~` ``
If you use any additional special characters, the sorting behavior may be inconsistent.

So that the `+` character encoded to `%2B` stays valid, the query parameters need to be encoded in accordance
with [encodeURIComponent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent). 
You can always leave out the `+` character, because the user list appears in ascending order by default. 

**Pagination**

For a better overview, you might like to view the list of users in pages instead of in one long list.
To request a paginated response, add the query parameters `page` and `per_page`. 
You'll need to set the `page` parameter. The page count always starts at `1`.
By default, `per_page` is set to `10`. You can display as many as 500 users per page. This is an optional parameter. 

If you request a paginated response, Acrolinx will add the following header values:

| Header                     | Description                                     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `X-Acrolinx-Page`          | The index of the current page, starting at `1`. |
| `X-Acrolinx-Next-Page`     | The index of the next page.                     |
| `X-Acrolinx-Previous-Page` | The index of the previous page.                 |
| `X-Acrolinx-Total-Pages`   | The total number of pages.                      |
| `X-Acrolinx-Total`         | The total number of items.                      |

In addition to the header values, the response object contains a few URLs
within the `links` object:

| Relation | Description                       |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `next`   | The URL to get the next page.     |
| `prev`   | The URL to get the previous page. |
| `first`  | The URL to get the first page.    |
| `last`   | The URL to get the last page.     |

If there aren't any next or previous pages, you won't see the `next` and `prev` links.
For example, when you view page 1, you won't see a `prev` link because there's no page 0. 
This is also the case for the values in the headers.

**Note:** When you switch to the next or previous page, you'll see the current paginated view at the time of the API call. 
This will also reflect any changes to the underlying data source. Say you're on page 2 of 10 with 10 records per page. 
You then decide to delete 10 users before you call the API to fetch page 3. Now when you switch to page 3, the response will show page 3 of 9.

The example response includes the pagination URLs and query parameters in the `links` object so you know what to expect. 

**Dynamically include/exclude nested data**

If you manage a large number of users, you can use the query params `includeCustomField` and `excludeProperties` to filter nested data.

By default, all custom fields are nested in the user model.
You can use the parameter `includeCustomField` to limit the returned fields to those that match the key passed in the param value.
This is helpful if you want to fetch a specific set of custom fields to reduce data transfer.
To include more than one custom field, add `&includeCustomField={Key}` to the request N times.

+ Parameters

    + username (string, optional) - Optional query parameter for searching by username.
    + fullName (string, optional) - Optional query parameter for searching by full name.
    + sort (enum[string], optional) - Optional query parameter for sorting by an attribute. 
            
        + Prefix the field with:
            + **"+"** for ascending order, or
            + **"-"** for descending order. 
        + **Note:** 
            + Omitting a prefix will sort in ascending order.
            + Use `customFields.{key}` to sort by custom fields, `{key}` is the name of the custom field

        + Default: username

### Create a User [POST /api/v1/user]

**Added in Core Platform version 2021.05**

**Note:**

- The username needs to be unique and is limited to 255 characters.
- The `fullName` field is limited to 255 characters (optional).
- The license type can either be "named" or "concurrent" (optional).
- You need `UserAndRoles.editUser` privileges to perform this request.

**Password Requirements**

If you want to create a user, the password field is required as of Core Platform version 2022.02.
Your password needs to meet the following requirements:

- Composed of ASCII printable characters
- Needs to include at least 1 lower case letter
- Needs to include at least 1 upper case letter
- Needs to include at least 1 digit
- Needs to include at least 1 special character symbol
- At least 10 characters long
- No more than 64 characters long

For Core Platform versions 2021.05 to 2022.02, the following apply:

- Password is optional
- At least 1 character long
- No more than 128 characters

**Be extra careful in the following cases:** 
- There are no configured default roles. That means that no roles will be automatically assigned to new users.
- Federated authentication is enabled:
  - Users are created automatically with federated authentication.
  - Only users created by the identity provider can sign in to the Acrolinx Dashboard.
  - Users created through the API can only be used for automation purposes. For example, interactions with the Platform API.


+ Request Create a user (application/json)

     This will create a new user if you add a username, fullName, and password to the request. 

    **Note:** By default, Acrolinx will automatically assign the user the license type `named` and the role `Author`.

+ Request Update roles (application/json)

    You can update a user's role.

    In this example, only the `roles` attribute will change for the user `fred`. This was identified in the database by its *id*. Each user needs at least one assigned role. This doesn't apply to built-in users. You can only assign Super Administrator role if you have Super Administrator role. If you add a role that doesn't exist, the call will fail and the error message will show the unknown roles that were referenced.

## Missing Required User Custom Fields [/api/v1/user/custom-fields-missing]

**Added in Core Platform version 2022.04**

You can query users who don't have required custom fields.

**What's a missing required custom field?** The User API returns your user-related custom fields in the `customFields[]` array. If a custom field is required (marked with `"inputType": "required"`) and is missing a value (`"value": ""`), the field is considered to be missing.

**Note:**
- You need the `UserAndRoles.editUser` privilege.

### Count Users [HEAD /api/v1/user/custom-fields-missing]

Returns the total number of users who are missing one or more required user custom field.

**Note:**
- The response has no content.
- The user count will be shown in the header `X-Acrolinx-Total`.
- The header value is a numeral.
- It returns a 0 (zero) when no required custom fields are missing.

+ Request

    Query the number of users who are missing information in one or more required user custom fields.

## User-Generated API Tokens [/api/v1/user/{id}/tokens]

You can generate long-lasting API tokens for programmatic access to the Platform APIs.

Acrolinx protects its APIs with self-contained access tokens. These access tokens let you authorize yourself as a user. API tokens have different characteristics than the access tokens that are issued when you use the sign-in endpoint.

Don't forget to check out the *Introduction > Authentication and Authorization* section in this API Blueprint.

Be aware that you can only be bound to one API token at a time.
* When you create a new API token, your previous API token becomes invalid.

**Warning:** Follow these security guidelines when you work with API tokens:
+ Store your API token securely and never share it with others.
+ Don't bake your API token into any custom code that interacts with the Acrolinx Platform APIs.

**Note:** To learn more about creating API tokens in Acrolinx, read [Create an API Token](https://support.acrolinx.com/hc/en-us/articles/10306041244818-Create-an-API-Token) in the Acrolinx documentation.

### Create an API Token (Self)  [POST /api/v1/user/self/tokens]

**Added in Core Platform version 2021.06**

Use this method to create an API token for the current user.

**Note:** You don't need extra privileges or roles to create a new personal API token bound to the user authorized in the request.

**Note:** This endpoint lets users use the Basic authentication scheme to avoid reusing an existing API token.

+ Request Create an API token using Basic auth
    
    To authenticate using Basic auth, provide your username and password in the `X-Acrolinx-Auth` request header in the format `Basic username:password`. 

    * **Important:** 
        * This needs to have the prefix `Basic`.
        * Your credentials (`username:password`) must be base64 encoded.

### Create an API Token for User(s) [POST /api/v1/user/{id}/tokens]

**Added in Core Platform version 2021.05**

This method lets you create an API token for users based on their *id*.

Typical use cases for this API:
1. Create an API token for personal use
    - 1.1. Get your own unique identifier *id* via the *Current user* request.
    - 1.2. Enter your *id* as a parameter.
    - 1.3. Start using the issued API token.
2. Create an API token for someone else
    - 2.1. Get the unique identifier *id* for the other user via the *Get users* requests.
    - 2.2. Enter the other user's *id* as a parameter.
    - 2.3. Give the issued API token to the user securely.

**Note:** You can only create an API token if you have the appropriate permissions: 
* To create an API token for yourself, you need to be authorized with a valid access token.
* To create an API token for someone else, you need the privilege `UserAndRoles.setApiTokensForOthers` and you need to be authorized with a valid access token.

**Alternative use case:** Create an API token to impersonate a user

    Sometimes an admin might want to impersonate a user to help troubleshoot. 
    If a user comes across a bug, for example, an admin may want to impersonate the user to try and duplicate the problem.

+ Parameters
    + id: `eb323701-839f-4998-b56e-3e20c70259c5` (required, string) - UUID of the user, unique identifier

- Includes at least 1 uppercase letter
- Includes at least 1 digit
- Includes at least 1 special character
- At least 10 characters long
- No more than 64 characters long

**Note:**
- You need the `UserAndRoles.editUser` privilege.

## User Commands [/api/v1/user/{id}/_{command}]

The APIs in this group follow the API design command style.   

These administrative commands can help govern users in your Acrolinx instance. The commands can do more than simply (re)send the new state of a single resource. 

**Note:** You can apply these requests multiple times without changing the result (idempotent). 

### Release an Active Named User License [PUT /api/v1/user/{id}/_release]

**Added in Core Platform version 2021.05**

This method uses the *id* to release an active license consumed by a user.

**Note:**
- You can only release users with the `named` license type.
- If you release the license of a user who doesn't consume a license, you won't see an error.
- To do this, you need the `UserAndRoles.deleteSessions` privilege.

**Result:** User's `licenseStatus` changed from `active` to `inactive`.

+ Parameters
    + id: `eb323701-839f-4998-b56e-3e20c70259c5` (required, string) - UUID of the user, unique identifier

### Request User Information Update  [PUT /api/v1/user/{id}/_request_cf_update]

**Added in Core Platform version 2021.12**

The user specified by the *id* in this request will be asked to update their user information.

**Note:**
- The next time the user signs in, they'll need to re-enter their user information via a form.
- If you repeat the request for the same user UUID, you won't be notified that a request was already submitted.
- To do this, you need the `UserAndRoles.editUser` privilege.

+ Parameters
    + id: `eb323701-839f-4998-b56e-3e20c70259c5` (required, string) - UUID of the user, unique identifier

+ Request Ask one user to update their user information

### Export a List of Users [GET /api/v1/user/_export]

**Added in Core Platform version 2021.06**

This API provides an easy way to export a concise user list in various file formats.

The endpoint uses content negotiation to determine the format of the export. You can include the `Accept` header in your request to specify the format you prefer. See the `Supported formats` section for more information about the formats that Acrolinx currently supports.

**Supported formats:**
+ `text/csv` (default, file extension is `.csv`)

**Note:** If you don't specify the format in the `Accept` header, the default will be used.

**Content-Disposition:**

The API also returns the `Content-Disposition` response header to give information about the returned content. 
Based on this, browsers can recognize downloadable attachments that can be saved locally.

The header parameters are set as follows:
+ `attachment` - Indicates that the content should be downloaded.
+ `filename="acrolinx_users_export_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.{fileExt}"` - Most browsers present a "Save as" dialog for attachments. This will be prefilled with the value of the filename parameter.

+ Request Export a list of users in CSV format

    This lets you export a list of users and their data into a CSV file that looks like a spreadsheet but has a `.csv` extension.
    Each line of the file is a user data record. Each record consists of one or more user fields and the actual value, separated by column delimiter.
    You can use the CSV file with most spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

    You'll see the following user fields in the file (in the following order):
    + **user_id**: The user's unique identifier (string, UUID).
    + **Username**: The user's username, which can be used for sign in and user identification.
    + **Full Name**: The full name of the user.
    + **Roles**: A list of assigned roles.
    + **Created On**: Indicates when the user was created.
    + **Last Integration Access**: Indicates when the user last accessed an integration. If the user hasn't accessed an integration, the default value is `Never`.
    + **Checking Frequency**: Displays a rough idea of the user's usage pattern based on checking frequency across the user's lifetime in days. Its value can be [ "frequent", "infrequent', "regular" ].
    + **License Type**: Indicates the type of license. Its value can be ["named", "concurrent", "builtin"].
    + **{Custom Field name}**: Users can have multiple (0...N) custom fields that are also attached to the schema. 
        + For custom fields, the column name is mapped from the custom field's name (specified when you create it). The column will be added to the end of the sheet dynamically. 

    **Notes, about the CSV file and data formatting:** 
    + Column headers are also written into the first row of the file.
    + Fields are separated by a semicolon `;` (as column delimiter). 
    + Date and time values are exported in `UTC`, for example `2021-05-12T15:40:00.876Z`.
        + When there's no stored value for a given Date time type field, the cell should contain `Never` or an empty value.
    + Values of a list type field are separated with a colon `:` (as the "in-cell" delimiter).
    + Values that contain space characters are in double quotes in the file, for example, `user_id;Username;"Full Name";...`.

## User Bulk Operations [/api/v1/user/bulk]

These APIs let you perform bulk operations. Bulk operations follow the multi-status request and response model.
In this model, the incoming bulk request includes a list of objects that need to be processed (as opposed to using the same API many times). 
The response to the request is `207 Multi-Status`. The response includes a list of `results` for the objects that were processed successfully 
and a list of `errors` for the objects that couldn't be processed.

**Note:** Each API has a limit for bulk requests. User creation is an atomic operation, but the bulk request is nontransactional.

### Create Users in Bulk [POST /api/v1/user/bulk]

**Added in Core Platform version 2021.06**

This API lets you create a list of new users. All user objects follow the requirements and constraints
noted in the Create User API section.

**Note:** You can create up to 100 users per bulk request, the minimum is 1.

+ Request Create Users in Bulk (application/json)

    This request lets you create 5 new users by specifying some basic fields (`username`, `fullName`, `password`) in the request model.

    **Note:** Acrolinx will assign a license type and role automatically. These are typically the license type `named` and the role `Author`.

# Group Licenses API

**Available since Core Platform version 2021.06**

License information is provided by the following set of APIs.

## Statistics [/api/v1/licenses/statistics]

### Get License Statistics for Users [GET]

Returns license statistics for the running instance showing the sum of license types `named` and `concurrent`.
The following conditions are checked for all users in order to qualify them to be included in the calculation:

- Must be one of the following License Types `named` or `concurrent`
- For `named` license they must be active it must satisfy the following
    - Be activated for `Checking` session type
    - Must not be free of charge
- All other `named` licensed users will be considered `inactive`
- All `concurrent` licensed users will be `existing` if a license exists

**Note:** Built-in users such as `Admin`, `TermBrowser`, `TermTargetAccess`, `TermContribution`, `TermApiAccess`, and `AnalyticsReadOnlyUser`
are included in the license statistics along with all other users, but they are subject to the conditions above.

Details of the statistics attributes in the table below:

| License Type | Sum Attribute | Description                   |
|:-------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `named`      | licensed      | Total number of licenses      |
| `named`      | active        | Total active licenses         |
| `named`      | inactive      | Total inactive licenses       |
| `named`      | available     | Total available licenses (`licensed` minus `active`) |
| `concurrent` | licensed      | Total number of licenses      |
| `concurrent` | existing      | Total number of licenses used |

**Note:**
- Must have `UserAndRoles.editUser` privileges to perform this request
- Concurrent license numbers may be seen (non-zero) if a license has been configured for both `named` and `concurrent` user limits

# Group Role API

**Available since Core Platform version 2021.05**

In the Role API, Acrolinx defines a role as an entity that has an id, a name and list of privileges, and information on whether this role is a default role. 
You can use roles to group sets of privileges and assign them to different users.
Mark roles as default if you want to automatically assign at least one default role to all new users.

To read more about role-based access control in Acrolinx, see [User Roles](https://support.acrolinx.com/hc/en-us/articles/10210994316562-User-Roles).

**Note:** Before you get started with the Role API, be sure to review the [authentication and authorization](https://acrolinxapi.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/authentication-and-authorization) requirements.

## Privileges [/api/v1/roles/privileges]

Privileges determine if a user can perform an action via the API or Acrolinx Dashboard.

### Get All Privileges [GET]

This returns a list of all supported privileges.

**Note:** Depending on your Acrolinx version, the example response may look different than the response that you get for your supported privileges. 
In newer platform releases, there are rare instances where privileges might be introduced or removed. 
To find out which privileges come with your installation, submit this request and compare it to the example response.

### Update a Role [PUT /api/v1/roles/{id}]

This lets you update a role that was identified by its *id* in the database.

**Note:** 
- To update roles, you need the privilege `UserAndRoles.editUser`.
- You can't edit the preconfigured roles!
    - Acrolinx comes with a number of preconfigured roles that are common in many organizations that use Acrolinx. 
- You can use one request to update role attributes individually or completely. The request will ignore missing attributes or attributes with `null` values.

+ Parameters
    + id: `f608876c-a943-4ad2-82c1-e59df943ce41` (required, string) - UUID of the role, unique identifier

+ Request Update entire model (application/json)

    You can use one request to update all attributes of a role.

    **Note:** Check the other request examples to see how to update individual attributes and validations.

+ Request Update the privileges that belong to a role (application/json)

    You can use roles to update the privileges that are assigned to a user.

    In this example, the `UserAndRoles.read` privilege will be assigned to the role `ExampleRole`. The role was identified by its *id* in the database. 

    **Note:**
    - A role needs to have at least one privilege assigned.
    - You can add/remove privilege(s). The server completely replaces every privilege.
    - There might be interdependencies with other privileges.
    - Any changes to a role are automatically inherited by all users with that particular role.
    - You need to reference existing privileges. See [Get All Privileges](###Get_all_privileges).

    **Warning:** This action **permanently** updates the privileges that belong to a role. 
    When you change the privileges for a role, all users with that role will get the updated set of privileges.

# Group Document API

Here, a document is an entity that associates names/characteristics that identify a document with an ID. It also contains the custom document information.

Typical program flow:

1. A document is opened in the host editor.
2. The integration uses create or retrieve document information, to check if the custom fields have to be filled out.
    If the user has to fill out custom fields, the API returns all fields to fill out and the set values.
3. The integration requests the user to fill out the custom field.
4. The integration sets the new custom fields either using the update document function or while submitting a check request.

# Group Dictionary API

This API handles the spelling dictionary.
Items listed in the spelling dictionary are ignored (not flagged) by the spelling checker.

## Dictionary Entry
From an API perspective, an "item" or *dictionary entry* has the following properties:

* `surface`: The string that isn't a spelling issue.
* `scope`: The range of influence of the spelling exception.
    * `language`
    * `guidanceProfile`
    * `document`
* `languageId`: The language in which the surface shouldn't be a spelling issue.
* `guidanceProfileId`: The guidanceProfile for which the surface shouldn't be a spelling issue.
* `documentId`: The document in which the surface shouldn't be a spelling issue.

Depending on the `scope`, the -`Id`-values are optional or mandatory:

* `scope=language` requires a `languageId` (or alternatively an `guidanceProfileId`).
* `scope=guidanceProfile` requires an `guidanceProfileId`.
* `scope=document` requires a `documentId` and alternatively a `languageId` or an `guidanceProfileId`.

The `documentId` is a persistent identifier of the document from the Acrolinx Analytics reporting database.

(Tip: With an `guidanceProfileId` and a `documentId` you're always on the safe side.)

(Tip: guidance profiles have languages.
Keep `languageId` and `guidanceProfileId` consistent in that respect if sending both.
Otherwise the winner depends on the `scope`.)

## Get Dictionary Capabilities [GET /api/v1/dictionary/capabilities]

This method enables the integration to discover the available dictionary scopes.
(The availability of scopes depends on the server configuration and the user's privileges.)

Alternatively, you can retrieve the available scopes from a check result:

```
data.dictionaryScopes: [ "language", "guidanceProfile", "document" ]
```

+ Response 200 (application/json)

        {
          "data": {
            "scopes": [ "language", "guidanceProfile", "document" ]
          }
        }



## Add to Dictionary [POST /api/v1/dictionary/submit]

Create a dictionary entry for the specified scope.

Beware:
Spell checking is a multifaceted functionality.
Whether or not a particular issue will disappear after adding it to the dictionary, depends on the issue's true nature.
The spelling checker tells you if you can reasonably suppress an issue by adding a surface to the dictionary.
In the check result:

```
issues[n].canAddToDictionary: true
```

+ Request (application/json)

# Group Monitoring API

**Since Core Platform 2019.10**

The resources in this group provide information about the health and performance of the Acrolinx Platform.
Accessing this information requires the permission "Access to monitoring API." This privilege isn't granted
to all users. Make sure the user associated with your API token has the requisite roles.

For a quick check of your permissions see if the [metrics index](#monitoring-api-get-available-metrics)
contains links. More information about permission management can be found in the
[Acrolinx documentation](https://support.acrolinx.com/hc/en-us/sections/10210965582994-User-Management).

## Get Available Metrics [GET /api/v1/monitoring]
